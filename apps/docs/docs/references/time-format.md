# Time format

Certain commands require a time to function. Luckily, KBot allows you to enter times and durations
in an intuitive way.

## Examples

All of the below examples represent: `1 day, 2 hours, and 3 minutes`.
`d` represents day, `h` represents hour, and `m` represents minute.

- `1d2h3m`
- `1 day 2 hours 3 minutes`
- `1d, 2h, 3m`
- `1d and 2 hours and 3m`
