# Credits

It's not uncommon to credit artists when adding emote or sticker to your server.
However, it's not easy creating or keeping all of the info update to date.
This feature provides an easy solution to that.

::: tip Required channel permissions
KBot needs these permissions in the set channel to be able to send messages: `View Channel`, `Send Messages`, `Embed Links`.
:::

## Setup

To enable credits, set a channel with [/credits set](/commands#credits-set).

## Disabling credits

To disable emote credits, just remove the set channel with [/credits unset](/commands#credits-unset).

## Adding credits

### For new emotes and stickers

For emotes that you need to add to the server, you can use [Add Emote](/commands#add-emote) which provides you a button to create the credits entry.

### For existing emotes/stickers

For emotes and stickers that have already been uploaded to the server, you can add them with [/credits emote](/commands#credits-emote) and [/credits sticker](/commands#credits-sticker).

## Editing credits

To edit credits, all you need to do is click the `Edit info` button on the entry. This will bring up a modal where you can edit the info.

## Refresing the name

Since the credit entry won't be able to know if you change the emote name, all you need to do to refresh it is press the `Refresh name` button.
