# Permissions

## Default Command Permissions

These are the permissions that each command has on by default before you make any changes. They can be edited by going to `Server Settings` -> `Integrations` -> `KBot`

For example: a user would need `Manage Server` to be able to use `Events`, `Manage Emojis` to use `Add Emote`, etc.
