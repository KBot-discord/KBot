# Polls

Polls allow you to easily get a response from users about a particular question or topic.

::: tip Required channel permissions
KBot needs these permissions in the poll channel to be able to send messages: `View Channel`, `Send Messages`, `Embed Links`.

## Creating a poll

To create a poll, use [/poll create](/commands#poll-create).

## Ending a poll

To end a poll, use [/poll menu](/commands#poll-menu) and then click the `End poll` button on the chosen poll.

## Getting results without ending the poll

Sometimes you want to get the results of a poll without ending it.

To do so, use [/poll menu](/commands#poll-menu) and click the either `Show current votes (hidden)` or `Show current votes (public)` button depending on if you want the response to be only shown to you or not.
